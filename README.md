# scalanative-obj-interop
This project is a protoype for a Scala Native interop layer that allows idiomatic Scala to be used with external object systems. Read [Scala Native Interop for External Object Systems](https://github.com/jokade/scala-native/blob/topic/external-objects-design/docs/design/external_objects_interop.rst#syntactic-sugar) for more information about the object systems targeted, and the interop concepts explored in this project.
